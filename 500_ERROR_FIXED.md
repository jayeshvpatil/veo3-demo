# 🎉 500 Error FIXED - App Successfully Deployed!

## ❌ Problem Identified
Your deployed app was returning **500 Internal Server Error** with this specific error:
```
Error starting Veo generation: ReferenceError: File is not defined
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The issue was in `/app/api/veo/generate/route.ts` on line 38:
```typescript
if (imageFile && imageFile instanceof File) {
```

**Problem**: The `File` class is a browser-specific Web API that doesn't exist in Node.js runtime environments (like Cloud Run). When the code tried to check `instanceof File`, it failed because `File` is undefined in Node.js.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed the File Check**
**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
if (imageFile && imageFile instanceof File) {
  const buf = await imageFile.arrayBuffer();
  const b64 = Buffer.from(buf).toString("base64");
  image = { imageBytes: b64, mimeType: imageFile.type || "image/png" };
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Check if the imageFile has the required methods (works in both browser and Node.js)
if (imageFile && typeof imageFile === 'object' && 'arrayBuffer' in imageFile) {
  const fileObject = imageFile as { arrayBuffer(): Promise<ArrayBuffer>; type?: string };
  const buf = await fileObject.arrayBuffer();
  const b64 = Buffer.from(buf).toString("base64");
  const mimeType = fileObject.type || "image/png";
  image = { imageBytes: b64, mimeType };
}
```

### 2. **Why This Fix Works**
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works in both browser and Node.js environments
- ✅ **Type Safe**: Proper TypeScript typing without `any` types
- ✅ **Duck Typing**: Checks for the required methods rather than class inheritance
- ✅ **Robust**: Handles the file object regardless of its exact type

## 🚀 Status: DEPLOYED & WORKING
