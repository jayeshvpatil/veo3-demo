# Product Selection Fix - Assets Page

## Issue
Product selection wasn't working on the Assets page - clicking on products would navigate to visual generation screens instead of simply selecting the product for use in the Create tab.

## Root Cause
The "Select Product" button was actually calling `handleSelectForVideo()` which:
1. Set local state `selectedId`
2. Opened the VisualGeneration screen
3. Did NOT update the ProductContext

This meant:
- ❌ Selected product wasn't available in Create tab
- ❌ No way to simply select a product without generating visuals
- ❌ Context wasn't synchronized with UI selection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Product Selection Handler
Created a new `handleSelectProduct()` function that:
- ✅ Updates ProductContext with `setContextSelectedProduct(product)`
- ✅ Sets local selected ID for UI highlighting
- ✅ Makes product available throughout the app

```typescript
const handleSelectProduct = (product: Product) => {
  // Simply select the product in context for use in Create tab
  setContextSelectedProduct(product);
  setSelectedId(product.id);
};
```

### 2. Imported Context Functions
```typescript
const { 
  addProductToPrompt, 
  selectedProduct: contextSelectedProduct, 
  setSelectedProduct: setContextSelectedProduct 
} = useProduct();
```

### 3. Updated Product Card Buttons
Changed from single "Create Stunning Visuals" button to three distinct actions:

**Before:**
```
[Create Stunning Visuals]  ← Went directly to visual generation
[Chat with AI Agent]
```

**After:**
```
[Select Product]           ← NEW: Simple selection for Create tab
[Create Stunning Visuals]  ← Visual generation workflow
[Chat with AI Agent]       ← AI chat workflow
```

### 4. Updated Visual Feedback
- Card border shows blue ring when product is selected in context
- "Selected" badge overlay on product image
- Button shows "✓ Selected" when active
- Header displays selected product name

## User Flow Now

### Simple Product Selection:
```
1. User goes to Assets page
2. Clicks "Select Product" button
3. Product is highlighted with blue ring
4. Product becomes available in Create tab
5. User can switch to Create tab and use templates
```

### Visual Generation Workflow:
```
1. User goes to Assets page
2. Clicks "Create Stunning Visuals" button
3. Opens VisualGeneration screen (with style templates)
4. Generates professional product images
5. Returns to Assets page
```

### AI Chat Workflow:
```
1. User goes to Assets page  
2. Clicks "Chat with AI Agent" button
3. Opens AgenticVisualChat screen
4. Chats with AI to refine and generate images
5. Returns to Assets page
```

## What Changed

### File: `components/ui/ProductSelectionTab.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Import `selectedProduct` and `setSelectedProduct` from ProductContext
2. ✅ Add `handleSelectProduct()` function for simple selection
3. ✅ Keep `handleSelectForVideo()` for visual generation workflow
4. ✅ Add "Select Product" button as primary action
5. ✅ Update visual indicators to use `contextSelectedProduct`
6. ✅ Update header to show selected product name

**Button Order (top to bottom):**
1. **Select Product** - Blue button, primary action, syncs with context
2. **Create Stunning Visuals** - Purple button, opens visual generation
3. **Chat with AI Agent** - Purple button, opens AI chat

## Benefits

### 1. Clear Separation of Actions
- ✅ Select product for general use (Create tab)
- ✅ Generate visuals from Assets (standalone workflow)
- ✅ Chat with AI from Assets (standalone workflow)

### 2. Context Synchronization
- ✅ Selected product is available app-wide
- ✅ Create tab can access selected product
- ✅ No product selection needed when using templates

### 3. Better UX
- ✅ Visual feedback (blue ring, checkmark, badge)
- ✅ Clear button labels
- ✅ Non-blocking selection (stay on Assets page)
- ✅ Header shows what's selected

### 4. Flexible Workflows
- ✅ Quick selection for Create tab usage
- ✅ Deep-dive visual generation when needed
- ✅ AI-assisted creation available
- ✅ All three can be used for same product
